Pinterest Data Pipeline
Project Overview:
The Pinterest Data Pipeline project is a meticulously crafted system aimed at extracting, storing, transforming, and analyzing emulated Pinterest post data. With an emphasis on robustness and efficiency, this project encompasses the creation of two intricately designed data pipelines: one tailored for batch processing and the other fine-tuned for real-time processing of streaming data. The core objective is to provide a hands-on learning experience while mastering a suite of cutting-edge data engineering tools and services.

Key Components and Technologies:
Programming Language:
Python: The project harnesses the power of Python for executing Pinterest posting emulation via AWS RDS queries. Additionally, it facilitates seamless interactions with Kafka and AWS Kinesis through meticulously crafted API requests.
Data Ingestion:
Kafka (Using Amazon MSK): Kafka stands at the forefront of data ingestion, gracefully handling the raw Pinterest data influx and proficiently routing it to designated topics within an S3 bucket. This setup ensures streamlined batch processing in Databricks.

Step-by-Step Setup:

Provision Amazon MSK cluster through the AWS Management Console.
Configure your MSK cluster settings, including the number of brokers, instance types, security settings, etc.
Create topics within your MSK cluster to organize incoming data.
Update Kafka configurations in your application code to connect to the provisioned MSK cluster.
Infrastructure:
Amazon EC2: The backbone of the Kafka client machine, Amazon EC2 plays a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless operation and integration of Kafka within the data pipeline ecosystem.
Workflow Orchestration:
Apache Airflow (Using Amazon MWAA): Task scheduling and orchestration are seamlessly managed by Apache Airflow, powered by Amazon MWAA. This dynamic duo ensures the timely execution of batch processing tasks, thereby orchestrating a symphony of data workflows with unparalleled precision.
Real-time Data Processing:
Amazon Kinesis: Real-time data processing reaches new heights with Amazon Kinesis, serving as the bedrock for ingesting raw Pinterest data as data streams. This enables lightning-fast real-time processing in Databricks, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights in the blink of an eye.
API Gateway:
Amazon API Gateway: The deployment of a robust REST API through Amazon API Gateway facilitates seamless communication between Amazon MSK and Kinesis. This ensures frictionless data flow and fosters a cohesive ecosystem conducive to innovation.
Data Transformation and Analysis:
Databricks: Databricks emerges as the undisputed champion for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. With its prowess in both batch and real-time processing modes, Databricks executes SQL queries with finesse, unraveling key metrics and unveiling profound insights hidden within the vast expanse of processed data.
